# [FIDO2 Smart Card for Medical record maintenance and Temporary Token Authentication for in-house hospital patients](https://medical-record.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com)

The importance of a good record cannot be undermined. A good medical record serves the interest of the medical practitioner as well as his patients.  Changing technology and legislation have ushered in a shift in healthcare which led to the discovery of several drawbacks and potential challenges. As the popularity of electronic health record storage grows, a special concern arises for the privacy and security of patient data. Hence we introduce AthenaMR, a seamless and fast web-based framework for leveraging digital data storage processes to sustainably serve patients from all backgrounds. It uses FIDO2 Smart Card for Medical record maintenance and Temporary Token Authentication for in-house hospital patients. It simplifies the entire storage process and can be accessed using NFC, BLE, or USB. Moreover, the private information never leaves the trusted device and prevents any sort of remote hijack. Under the theme of healthcare, this project is a web-based framework where we decided to come up with a FIDO2-based card that can change the world by making single-stop medical record storage instruments extremely seamless and secure compared to any other existing methods.

In this projectwe implement FIDO2, a recently evolved technology by FIDO Alliance which is on its way to prove itself to be
instrumental in Passwordless authentication frameworks. However, it can used for much more than
just authentication. This project proposes a centralized system for medical record maintenance of women in an extremely seamless, secure and easy to use manner.
 We aim to have a partnership with various hospitals. It guarantees easy record maintenance
and hence the patients will not have to go about the hospitals with an entire medical file.

## How our idea is unique?![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87559560/174490186-2db4669c-7e79-4e04-951b-eaf8c4cc6911.png)
 
Unless concerns about privacy and security that relate to patient information are addressed, it can cause there to be relatively low EMR adoption by a number of health institutions. AthenaMR, a web-based framework enables FIDO2 via simple API calls across all supported browsers and platforms on billions of devices consumers use every day. FIDO2 cryptographic login credentials are unique across every website, biometrics or other secrets like passwords never leave the user’s device and are never stored on a server. This security model eliminates the risks of phishing, all forms of password theft, and replay attacks. Because FIDO keys are unique for each Internet site and each user, they cannot be used to track you across sites hence ensuring the highest level of privacy.​ Hence there is no way an attacker can remotely access the account without physically accessing the card.​ In addition, the implementation is extremely seamless. Patients can easily generate temporary NFC tags for patients via the online portal. Moreover, the platform provides a centralized system for medical record maintenance for everyone. It guarantees easy record maintenance and hence the patients will not have to go about the hospital with an entire medical file.
